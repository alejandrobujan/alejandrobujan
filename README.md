# Hi there! My name is Alejandro Buján 👋

🎓 First and foremost, I am a CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) Student and I like what I do.

🔭 I also obtained a Research Collaboration Grant in the [Databases Lab. Research Group](https://lbd.udc.es/MainPage.do?lang=en_US) of the Department of Computer Science, University of A Coruña, where I am delving into aspects such as Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, version control systems and code generation based on Model-Driven Development.

🌎 I feel comfortable in international contexts, since I have studied part of my degree at [Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/), I have completed a stay at the [Learnovate Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland](https://www.learnovatecentre.org/), as well as internships in companies in Turin, Italy and Lisbon, Portugal.

🏅 I also won a few national and regional academic awards during my years as a CSE student.

These are my main skills:

+ **Programming**: Java, JS, Python, C, C#, Visual Basic, Elixir.
