# Hi there! My name is Alejandro Buján 👋

🎓 First and foremost, I am a CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) student and I like what I do.

🔭 Currently, I am working within the framework of a research grant at [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/), focusing on Virtual Reality and its enrichment through process mining as main topics, and I am also part of the [Databases Lab. Research Group](https://lbd.udc.es/MainPage.do?lang=en_US) of the Department of Computer Science, University of A Coruña, where I am delving into aspects such as Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, version control systems and code generation based on Model-Driven Development.

🌎 I feel comfortable in international contexts, since I have studied part of my degree at [Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/), I have completed a stay at the [Learnovate Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland](https://www.learnovatecentre.org/), as well as internships in companies in Turin, Italy and Lisbon, Portugal.

🏅 I also won a few national and regional academic awards during my years as a CSE student.
