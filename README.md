My name is Alejandro and I am passionate about IT.

From the beginning of my life, I have been in contact with new technologies, resulting in a love-hate relationship that ended up normalizing and becoming part of me.

Currently, I am 21 years old and a Computer Science Engineering student at the University of A Coruña, as well as a Higher Technician in Multi-platform Applications Development and a Technician in Microcomputer Systems and Networks, holding both titles with honours.

Furthermore, I achieved awards and recognitions such as the Bronze (National) and Gold (Autonomous) Medals in the discipline of Computer Network Systems Management in the official 2018-19 Vocational Training championships carried out by the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MEFP).

During my professional career, I completed internships in companies from different cities such as Dublin, Lisbon, and Turin. It helped me to certify a C1 level in English and a B1 level in Portuguese.

I am familiar with technologies such as:

+ Programming: Java, Python, C#, Visual Basic .NET, JS, PHP.
+ DBMS: MySQL / MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle.
+ OS Administration: GNU / Linux and Windows.
+ Cloud: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
+ Networks, firewalls, computer security.
